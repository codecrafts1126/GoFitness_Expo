Hi
I am Silas
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:29 PM
Hi
You 11/08 10:30 PM
Hi
question?
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:30 PM
Yes please
You 11/08 10:30 PM
I already ran your app.
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:30 PM
Ok
You 11/08 10:31 PM
right?
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:31 PM
yes
But the login is hitting the Firebase
You 11/08 10:32 PM
I see
Do you have back-end?
"Need to change the access to use the personal backend instead of Firebase"
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:34 PM
yes
Of course
You 11/08 10:34 PM
for this, would you provide back-end or api?
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:34 PM
Working on it
But for example
Check the code
There‚Äôs examples how to reach the backend
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:34 PM
Not from the Signup and login
Check the Workouts for example
You 11/08 10:35 PM
can you share code of back-end?
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:36 PM
I will gave you access to Mysql and FTP
It will be fine?
You 11/08 10:36 PM
OK
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:36 PM
let me prepare it for you
You 11/08 10:36 PM
did you use cpanel?
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:36 PM
Yes but I‚Äôve many other websites there
so I can‚Äôt share full access to it
You 11/08 10:36 PM
understand
don't worry
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:37 PM
Sharing with you all the relevant details hold on
You 11/08 10:37 PM
I need only api for login
OK
and for test, would you send current login account for app?
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:38 PM
Of course
You 11/08 10:39 PM
and, what should i add for social id?
facebook and google
and then?
You 11/08 10:40 PM
"Social ID Number" is mean, facebook login and google login
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:40 PM
Where?
You 11/08 10:40 PM
right?
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:40 PM
In the Settings ?
No no
It‚Äôs National ID
You 11/08 10:41 PM
got it
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:41 PM
It‚Äôs not related to Social media
In the APP that you have shared with me
I also liked the Membership purchase screen
You 11/08 10:42 PM
https://prnt.sc/pu9qd5
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:42 PM
Can we do something similar to it?
I know - but it‚Äôs a Person National/Goverment ID
Citizenship number
You 11/08 10:43 PM
understand
so, I can do it for first requirement after you provide api.
right?
would you send login account for test?
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:49 PM
For now you can register 
You 11/08 10:49 PM
OK
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:49 PM
It will be registered in Firebase
Then you can login
You 11/08 10:49 PM
got it
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:49 PM
To check the whole App
But still you need to improve all those screens
I mean the login and the signup ‚Ä¶
Right?
You 11/08 10:51 PM
first i will change signup page
ok?
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:52 PM
Ok
Please work on the design
You 11/08 10:52 PM
https://prnt.sc/pu9vvl
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:52 PM
And will share the APIs
You 11/08 10:52 PM
OK
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:52 PM
Make a nice screen and easy for the user
üôÇ
I think you have to prepare the i18n for the multi language as well
It‚Äôs better to deal with it now, no?
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 10:53 PM
What do u think?
You 11/08 10:54 PM
OK
You 11/08 10:59 PM
for multi language, only en, he, ar?
You 11/08 11:04 PM
Hi, Question?
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 11:07 PM
I may add more
But it‚Äôs not a matter now
In general I need 3 language so far
You 11/08 11:07 PM
so should i implement RTL?
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 11:07 PM
Of course for both AR and HE
You 11/08 11:07 PM
I see
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 11:08 PM
Send me your email address to forward you the FTP details
You 11/08 11:09 PM
star.master.1126@outlook.com
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 11:09 PM
ok
You 11/08 11:10 PM
where should i add change language?
in setting menu
right?
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 11:15 PM
Sent 
Right
But my question is more related to the login and sign up screens
How to let the user select other language
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 11:16 PM
It‚Äôs valid for Login / Sign up and Forgot password
You 11/08 11:18 PM
recieved
so, I will select language first page before login
i will add option for select language on start page
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 11:20 PM
Exactly also in the Settings cause once the user login 
You 11/08 11:20 PM
got it
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/08 11:24 PM
Please note that no need to do login every time 
Once login done, the next time user will redirected directly to the main page
Agreed?
I think it‚Äôs working same now
You 11/08 11:27 PM
Hi, Can you share back-end code and db?
11/09/19
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/09 12:22 AM
?
You 11/09 12:22 AM

Rabia Abu Hanna 11/09 12:22 AM

Rabia Abu Hanna 11/09 2:22 AM

Rabia Abu Hanna 11/09 5:10 PM
Very nice
Have you succeeded to login and reach the main page?
I can see several issues
1. The languages - Don‚Äôt put arrows, let the user swipe the fingers left & right
2. The Back button is not functioning as expected - I‚Äôm not blaming you but can you check why need to click many times to work?
3. Same for the button, the messages not really nice - and very slow to visible! Can you change the messages to be nicer and more hiTech?
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/09 5:34 PM
Here
You 11/09 5:34 PM
Don't say about zoom on freelancer
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/09 5:34 PM

Rabia Abu Hanna 11/09 5:35 PM
Sue
NP
I‚Äôve replace with *Room

You 11/09 5:36 PM
OK
2. my mistake
it's working as well
I failed my touch
understand?
button is small
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/09 5:37 PM
But I think it‚Äôs too much goes to left
Maybe it needs to be more to right
No?
You 11/09 5:37 PM
it's no problem
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/09 5:37 PM
Again, I want your best in UI side
I like great design
It‚Äôs User experience 
I don‚Äôt want to claim on it
Customers**
BTW
I want to explain you something very important
I will create other Applications based on this one
So can you please put all the customisation things such like pictures, strings, icons and other changes in ONE PLACE?!
So when trying to create a new App, I want to change everything including the colours from one place
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/09 5:40 PM
Can you please keep this thing in your mind?
You 11/09 5:41 PM
why your requirement is changed often?
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/09 5:41 PM
No no
It‚Äôs not changing man
But again
I don‚Äôt want to change common things from multiple locations
You 11/09 5:42 PM
so, do you want to new design for this app?
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/09 5:42 PM
Not really
I‚Äôm explaining myself again
You 11/09 5:42 PM
or else do you want to fix based your project?
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/09 5:42 PM
First
You‚Äôre the experience person
I think you should make this App awesome and very nice, right?
So if you see something not good, I expect you to change it or fix it or improve it
as you can see right to do
You 11/09 5:44 PM

I am going on so
Rabia Abu Hanna 11/09 5:44 PM

Did you review it?
You 11/09 5:45 PM

Rabia Abu Hanna 11/09 5:46 PM
