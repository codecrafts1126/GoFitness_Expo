User Avatar
Max 600$

User Avatar
Means?
i want to work step by step.
so first. for login screen: can you create milestone $50
and then second: for signup screen: $50
etc
it's fair
and clean
User Avatar
Fair but not clear for me how I should pay till production!!
total $ 800?
this is min budget.
Will I got 650$ Max price from two developers
You're making it difficult for me now
User Avatar
Hhhh
OK
$600

clear, total $600
Max till prod?
User Avatar
Including Support after production for fixing bugs
i can't do it less $600
Again
I mean
this price is the max payment I've to pay till uploading the App into Apple store and Google play, also includes Bug fixes for specific date after the production
User Avatar
I'm I right?
ok
Look I like the design of the App you've shared with me
User Avatar
It's yours or for some company?
do you want to complete exist project you gave me?
or else want new project?
Mine contains more features
But maybe you we can use few components from your app it will be perfect to have a better design
User Avatar
It's about the design not the functionality
ok

Perfect
Few minutes
Ok
User Avatar
What is the next step now?
first create milestone $50 for login page, I need 2 days for login page.
Just sec
Do you have back-end?
Do you want expo project?
I will use react-native-cli.
how think about it?
User Avatar
Based on the Existing APP
OK
It's using json PHP backend and some with Firebase
and it's using expo
User Avatar
You're the developer and you have to decide
Could you provide back-end source or api?
Let me try add all to postman
so we can use it
User Avatar
It's ok?
OK, so would you provide only api?
As you like
User Avatar
I don't care
send me api documentation.
User Avatar
I can share all the PHP code and URL
OK
please send it
code and documentation
Hi
I have to prepare it for you
Meanwhile
I have to Award this project to you
User Avatar
right?
what's mean?
don't understand as well
my english is poor
I mean regarding the Freelancer website
I should do Award
so you can work on my project
User Avatar
correct?
right, but I can't do it by less $700
User Avatar
OK, total $650
This is what you've told me before 1 hour
User Avatar
Why you're keep changing ?
OK, so can you pay money per step?
first. for login: $50
We're back to discuss that again and it's not ok
We've decided together to pay 650$
I can gave you 15% now so you can continue
is it ok?
Leave the 15%
I will pay 100$ so you can start
User Avatar
is it fine?
no, i want to pay by step. but total budget is $650
I don't have problem with that
But you keep say 700$ ??
If it's Max. 650$ then let's do it per step which will not exceed the 650$
Do you Agree?
User Avatar
Silas?
OK, so timeline?
What do you mean in timeline
You have to tell me
User Avatar
You said it will be up to 20 days?
OK, min 20 days or max a month
